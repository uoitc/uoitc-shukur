LibLime Koha 4 - The next-generation release of the award-winning Koha
open-source integrated library system.

Koha is the first open-source Integrated Library System. Developed
initially in New Zealand by Katipo Communications, Ltd and first
deployed in January of 2000 for the Horowhenua Library Trust, it is
currently maintained by a team of software providers and library
technology staff from around the globe. Learn more about the Koha
project at http://koha.org/.

INSTALLATION
============

Koha runs on many Un*x-style systems, including a variety of Linux
distributions and Mac OS X.

Koha depends on a number of configuration dependencies provided by the
system.  Most notably, these include Oracle Corp's MySQL for primary
data storage, Apache Foundation's Lucene/Solr for MARC document
indexing, and Perl to tie all of these together. Recommended versions
are:

MySQL: >= 5.1.59
Solr: >= 3.6.1
Perl: >= 5.14.0

Lesser versions may suffice in many cases. Higher versions are nearly
always better.

It's advisable to use your system's package maanger to install
MySQL. Install Solr from tarball. It is *not* advisable to fuss about
too much--if at all--with the system-installed Perl. Installing the
hundreds of packages required by Koha can give rise to oddities in
version dependency chains and break system-level tools. Instead, using
a tool like Perlbrew enables you to create a whole separate Perl
instance and install all the of CPAN modules that Koha needs into
there. These instructions will assume a Perlbrew-based Perl
installation.

MySQL 5:
Create a database called "koha" owned by "kohaadmin" user, with a
password set. Note: kohaadmin must have at least the following
privileges: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and
LOCK TABLES.


Solr:
1. Install the Solr package from the tarball:
    tar xzf apache-solr-3.6.1.tar.gz
    cd apache-solr-3.6.1/
2. Copy the "example" directory to "koha":
    cp -a example koha
3. Delete the "koha/solr/conf" directory:
    rm -rf koha/solr/conf
4. Symlink the LibLime Koha solr conf directory in its place:
    ln -s $KOHA_BASE/etc/solr/conf ./koha/solr/conf
5. Start the Solr daemon:
    java -jar start.jar


LibLime Koha installation instructions:
1. perl Makefile.PL
   (you will be prompted to answer a number of questions)
2. (Install any missing dependencies indicated by make.)
3. make
4. make test 
5. make install
6. KOHA_CONF=~/koha-dev/etc/koha-conf.xml plackup app.psgi

Finally, browse to http://servername-staff:5000/ and answer the
questions to complete the installation.

The defaults will install Koha to places that follow relevant
standards, such as the File Hierarchy Standard. If you want to install
Koha to a different directory like /opt/koha, then replace step 1 with
(for example):

1. perl Makefile.PL INTRANET_CGI_DIR=/www/cgi-bin

You can change most of the defaults in a similar way, such as DB_HOST.
For full instructions on how to override the default settings, run:

$ perldoc installer/rewrite-config.PL

WHAT NEXT?
==========

1. Running the Web Installer allows you to install sample data for
    libraries, patrons, etc. You may want to install additional data
    such as bibliographic and authorities records.

    Note: you can also use the "Stage MARC records for import" from
    the Tools area of Koha's Staff Client to import a batch of MARC
    records.

2. Import:
    Bibliographic data in MARC21 format
    $ ./misc/migration-tools/bulkmarcimport.pl -file /path/to/marc.iso2709
    Authority data in MARC21 format
    $ ./misc/migration-tools/bulkauthimport.pl -file /path/to/auth.iso2709

3. Solr Index:
    $ ./misc/solrsync -v --bibs --auths --all --workers=4

    Once the indexing has completed, you will be able to search for
    records in your system.

4. Schedule regular index updates
    Run "misc/solrsync --bibs --auths --continuous" from daemontools
    or similar process manager. This will update the catalog every 20
    seconds by default.

    Alternatively, run "misc/solrsync --bibs --auths" periodically
    from cron. See the "--help" for full description of options.

5. To enable public Z39.50 service you'll need to edit
    etc/solr/solrzsrv.xml and change the <zurl> value to the base URL
    for your Solr service.
